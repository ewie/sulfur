A list of issues that may affect functionality in the future.

* The XML Schema serializer currently uses a temporary location to import the
  sulfur schema (containing definitions of non-standard types required by the
  DataGridService to be able to validate a record document). This URL must be
  changed when used in production (see file src/sulfur.js)

* The widget uses Leaflet for input and output of geolocation values. To
  initialize the map the widget requests the users current position using
  HTML5's geolocation when available. Unfortunately Firefox has a bug causing
  it not to provide the users current position or even an error, causing the
  map initialization to never happen. To circumvent this, the widget checks
  if the user-agent is Firefox version 24  OR HIGHER  and uses the
  coordinates (0,0) this should be changed accordingly (see file
  app/widget/view/value/geolocation.js) to properly handle any future Firefox
  version which may fix the bug.
