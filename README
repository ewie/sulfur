Setup
=====

By modifying the environment variable $PATH in the following way we can execute
binaries local to our project (containing directory node_modules/).

  $ echo "PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc

Clone the repository into a desired destination and install dependencies using
NPM.

  $ git clone <repo> <dest>
  $ cd <dest>
  $ npm i


Testing
=======

testem is used for testing the JavaScript code. To launch the test tool execute
the following command with a comma separated list of browser names.

  $ testem -l <browser...>

Tests are written as specs using mocha.


Building
========

To build the entire web application issue the following command.

  $ make build

This will bundle all JavaScript files into a single file and put it into
directory build/ along with index.html, style.css and icon.svg
