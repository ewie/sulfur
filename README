Sulfur is a library and web application to design W3C widgets performing CRUD
operations on a WebComposition/Data Grid Service.
It is the result of a student research project.

Requirements
============

The following tools are required for development. Dependencies are managed
using NPM.

git      >= 1.8
node.js  >= 0.10
npm      >= 1.3
make     >= 3.8

Setup
=====

By modifying the environment variable $PATH in the following way we can execute
binaries local to our project (containing directory node_modules/).

  $ echo "PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc

Clone the repository into a desired destination and initialize the submodules.
Finally install dependencies using NPM.

  $ git clone <repo> <dir>
  $ cd <dir>
  $ git submodule init
  $ npm i


Testing
=======

testem is used for testing the JavaScript code. To launch the test tool execute
the following command with a comma separated list of browser names.

  $ testem -l <browser...>

Tests are written as specs using mocha.


Building
========

To build the entire web application run make with either rule "build" or
"build-with-minify". The first retains a readable JavaScript, the latter
minifies all JavaScript.

  $ make build[-minify]

This will bundle all JavaScript files into a single file and put it into
directory build/ along with index.html, style.css and sulfur.svg
